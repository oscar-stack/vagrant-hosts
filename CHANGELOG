CHANGELOG
=========

2.8.2
-----

2018-06-05

This is a backwards compatible bugfix release.

  * The `exports` and `imports` attributes of the hosts provisioner now
    properly merge when a provisioner with the same name is definied in
    multiple scopes (e.g. global, per-vm, per-provider).

  * Added test coverage for Vagrant 2.1.


2.8.1
-----

2018-05-02

This is a backwards compatible bugfix release.

  * Added test coverage for Vagrant 1.9 and 2.0

  * Deprecated support for vagrant versions earlier than 1.8. These will be
    removed in the next major release.

  * Hostnames are now resolved to IP addresses using the Addrinfo library
    which wraps the system resolver. Previously the Resolv library was used
    which is a pure-Ruby DNS resolver that did not pick up system-specific
    configuration or behavior.

  * Host synchronization is supported for FreeBSD, thanks to Brian Shumate.

  * Errors that occur during host sync are now trapped and logged. This
    means that an unreachable host will no longer block other operations
    like `vagrant destroy`.

-----

2016-04-18

This is a backwards compatible feature release.

  * (GH-56) Added a special value, `@facter_ipaddress`, for host entries that
